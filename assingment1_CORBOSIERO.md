For this assignment, I chose the Discourse Studies Journal. The scope of this journal is discourse analysis and the structures and strategies of text and talk. The journal also looks at the cultural, political, and social functions of discourse. The questions I am trying to answer by choosing this journal for my topic model is to see how certain words co-occur based on critical approaches to language. I also wanted to see how my assumptions of certain words aligned with the connections they had in the topic model. 

When it was time for requesting the data from JSTOR I requested all data in the journal which is peer-reviewed. The year range of this journal is 1999-present. After I selected this information I began to create my topic model. I ended up choosing 30 topics but I tried out a bunch of different topics before coming to this decision. First I tried 25 then I tried out 70 which was too large, then I did 65, 60 and lastly I tried 30 which seemed like a good settling point. For my journal, even though there was a lot of data having 70, 65 and 60 topics was too many. I noticed with this many topics the words repeated several times which made the topics much broader and I was not able to get a closer reading on what the journal explores from having this many topics. If I were to change something in this topic model, I would have deleted the Spanish and French topic since it is just foreign contractions. 

At first glance, the word discourse can be found in several of the topics, but this makes sense since this journal is Discourse Studies, therefore, the word discourse will come up often. The topics spread from a wide array of topics but they all relate to how text and talk are incorporated in these topics. It further tells us the importance of speech and text in all areas of life. It seems like every area is represented, such as organizations, education, culture, identity, media, all which are important in present time. There are no shocking findings from this topic model since the journal began in 1999. Therefore, there is no shifts in critical vocabulary since not much has changed with discourse in the past 19 years. All the topics I created still play a vital role in society today. I did not think that Spanish or French would have shown up in this topic model but they did. The reason Spanish comes up is because of immigration and it is a second language in America. I was interested especially interested to see why French comes up and how that is relevant to Discourse Studies. It seems that French mass media was important to study for this journal. 

Topic models donâ€™t just reveal what you are writing about but how you are writing about it (Goldstone and Underwood, JDH, 2012). The Discourse Studies Journal reveals how speech has impacts on all variables of our life. This topic model even shows the ways that health-care professionals interact and write, how our identities are shaped, how children development, the law, media, and our everyday interactions, all of which are effected by discourse. Though topic modeling can be useful, there are limitations. Based on the methodological choices one makes results can differ (Goldstone and Underwood, JDH, 2012). This is very relevant to this assignment. Just by changing the number of topics I had the topic model changed drastically and therefore reflects on what topics become present in the model created. If another person were to create a topic model on this journal their interpretation could be much different just based on how many topics they chose.
