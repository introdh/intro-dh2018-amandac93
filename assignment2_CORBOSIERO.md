  For analyzing data, I decided to choose case 10010 which is involuntary confession, and 10110, self-incrimination; immunity from prosecution. For involuntary confession, suspects cannot be forced to incriminate themselves, and are read the Miranda warnings. Protection to suspects by Miranda can be illusory since police can engage in tactics that could make the confession involuntary. If interrogation process by police violate this, then the confession would be deemed involuntary. Self-incrimination states that a witness testifying can refuse to answer based on their right against self-incrimination granted by the fifth amendment. However, a prosecutor can override the privilege by giving the witness immunity from prosecution in exchange for testimony. I decided to choose these two cases because they are interrelated, yet differ in the process of receiving a testimony. In one case a person can confess from coercion and the other case a person can confess based on being granted immunity. 

  From the network analysis, I can conclude that most cases occurred during the very late 1940’s, 1950’s and 1960’s. The argument that could be raised from this year range is the enactment of the Miranda rights in 1966. Since then police had to inform people of their rights, particularly their right to remain silent, and because of this less cases of involuntary confession would arise, unless someone waived their rights or were warranted immunity. The most interesting point that can be found in this network analysis is the issue analysis, though the issue of self-incrimination and involuntary confession seem to be similar they are separated in the network. However, a self-incrimination case is clustered with involuntary confessions. The Lanza V. New York Case (1961), a self-incrimination case, had the petitioner convicted of violating a state statue, he refused to answer questions even after he was given immunity from prosecution. He contended that his conviction was a violation of his rights since a conversation he had with his brother in jail was recorded and transcribed and then used to interrogate the petitioner. The reason this case is clustered here is because other court cases were referenced as examples of involuntary confession and put in contrast to Lanza V. New York. The Lanza case did not try to use the recordings in a criminal trial confession and therefore the petitioner’s argument is deemed invalid based on other court cases involving involuntary confession.

  Another conclusion that could be reached from this network analysis is appeals for better judgement. The votes section of the network analysis can show how judges disagree with certain cases where there is a majority opinion, and in return this disagreement can affect future judgements in similar cases. The dissenting votes with a count of four are mainly clustered together which displays that the cases are similar in nature and have cited one another, however, there are four nodes that are clustered in another area which have a four-count vote. After researching these cases, it correlates to self-incrimination cases rather than involuntary confession. There are 12 clusters in this network analysis which shows that these communities cited each other’s cases. All of the clusters are connected as a large network, but an example of the cluster connection can be shown in Colorado V. Spring and Dunway V. New York. Colorado V. Spring is placed far away from its color coded cluster and is connected directly to group 4 with Dunway V. New York. In both of these cases petitioners voluntarily waived their Miranda Rights and incriminated themselves, and the Dunway case is cited in Springs. As seen by the separation of Springs from its cluster community, the gatekeeper shows that Colorado V. Springs is a case that links disparate parts of the citation. 

  The centrality shows the most important nodes and vertices in the network. The cases that are light blue and yellow are the most important. Spano V. New York is one of the most important nodes in the network. This case represented the Supreme Court’s movement away from determining whether police violated due process standards when provoking confessions and towards the modern rule in Miranda V. Arizona. 

  Network analyses are useful for an at glance synthesis of large scales of information or learning something new about an area you may not be an expert in (Weingart, personal blog, 2011). This information is useful for a student like me who is not an expert with Supreme Court cases, however, it may be limiting for a law student who wants a more in depth reading about certain cases. Also, when it comes to creating networks, documents that are closely related makes it harder to visual and analyze (Weingart, personal blog, 2011). In the case of this network, these two cases were quite similar which allowed for clusters and separation.
