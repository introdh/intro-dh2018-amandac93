Enjoying the city of Richmond. Finally have my car on campus so I feel very free.

I am a rhetoric and communications minor and I've never seen this course offered before in the department so I hopped on taking it. 

# Digital 
I helped create a [blog site](https://www.bakedbanquet.com)this summer at my internship. It was awesome being able to have creative freedom in choosing images and helping with the copy.
I also watched my favorite movie, "Almost Famous," for the 100th time. Not actually 100th time, but I love this [movie] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iyp0qcf7-w)
