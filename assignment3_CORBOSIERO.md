During the week of November 5th through the 11th I had a cross country meet. This assignment came at the perfect time because it truly highlights what a Division I cross country student-athlete’s life looks like. This is usually what my life looks every other week since cross country meets occur then. We travel all over the country for meets and rarely ever have a home meet. So far this season I have been to Pennsylvania, Delaware, Wisconsin, and South Carolina.  It can sometimes be hard to juggle long trips and academics but we find a balance. 

When choosing the layout page of my map I zoomed out far instead of just focusing on the University of Richmond campus. This was intentionally done to show how far I travel as a student-athlete, and how as athletes we are taken to different places due to the commitment we have to the team. I chose to include points in my map that would illustrate how my weeks look when we have races. The beginning of my race weeks start on campus and the Richmond area from Monday through Wednesday, but you can see how things become very focused on cross country once it comes Thursday due to meets that will either take place on Friday or Saturday. 

I decided do a mix of cover photos and the map because I personally liked the way that looked, and thought it would be more interesting for a viewer to follow. For my academic section I linked all the classes on the map to show the different locations on campus my classes take place. For my roommate dinner, I included a picture of the Queally Center because it is not recognized as a place in Google Maps. Since I babysit every week, I thought it should be included in my map because regardless if we have a race or not I always babysit this family on Wednesdays. After that point, my map is dominated by cross country. Traveling and meals are a big part of my life as a student-athlete. Our schedule is dictated by meal stops and finding time to run, that is why I included lunch, pre-race dinner, and post-race lunch. For my race day slide, I included a picture of me racing since I already showed on the map where Winthrop University was. I decided to end with free-time because I end every day the same way; watching YouTube, either at my apartment or the hotel if we are at a meet. 

Some critiques of spatial mapping are that people from different cultures will see a scene in a different way (Crampton, Wiley-Blackwell, 2010). For example, the Robins Center as a space can have different meaning for one person than it does for me. This reminds me of an experience I previously had where all student-athletes had to gather together at Richmond. I was sitting at a table with some football players and a picture of E. Claiborne Robins Stadium was shown to us and we were asked: “what is this?” Since I am on the track team, I said the track, and the football players said the football field. We viewed the same physical place differently. This is because when I am at that place my space there is on the track team and their space is on the football team. This proves that scenes or places are viewed differently based on our experiences. Furthermore, if this map was just presented as locations with no description people would not be able to understand the overall claim I am making. Because of the places I chose for my map as well as my descriptions the claim I am making is that my space is on the cross-country and track team at Richmond. 

Overall, maps are an incredibly useful way of organizing and producing knowledge about the world, but these orders of knowledge also incorporate unexamined assumptions about the world (Crampton, Wiley-Blackwell, 2010). You can learn a lot about a person just by looking at their spatial map, however, you must be careful not to assume that this map is a representation of everyone’s world. Just like I view the Robins Stadium as a track facility, the football players may view it as a football field, and that goes to show that the knowledge produced by maps are an inside perspective of the world of the map creator.
